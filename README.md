# aws_terraform
This project was started with the goal for create a good infrastructure template for AWS using terraform
For now, it will create an VPC with 1 public subnet with full access to internet and one private subtnet. (we can login in instances in public subnet with ssh from anywhere and to login in a instance in private subnet we only can login from a instance in public subnet)
